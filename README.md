## Requirement

- Windows

- RTX 2000 & 3000 series. A single 3090 GPU can support real-time visualization of an area of approximately 600m\*600m with a resolution of 1920*1080 and a frame rate of 40 frames per second.

## Usage

1. Download Unreal Engine 4,  version **4.25.4** is recommended. Then, create a game project category using C++.
2. Place the plugin files in the UE4 project directory.  Two larger plugin subfiles are placed in the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19PKH6zTlA1YpuhG0BNINHeWH-7CKiHzm?usp=drive_link) and we provide  models of the "highway" scenario.
3. config
